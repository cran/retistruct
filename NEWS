CHANGES IN VERSION 0.5.11 - Released 2017/07/15

RELEASE NOTES

* R 3.4.0 is required to run the graphical user interface (GUI),
  because there is no version of the RGtk2 package that works with
  earlier versions of R available on CRAN.

* There is a bug in version 1.0.5 of gWidgets2RGtk that prevents the GUI
  working. If you encounter this problem, work around it by typing

    install.packages("gWidgets2RGtk2")

  in the R console and then running retistruct() again. (You may need
  to quit R befor being able to run this command.) More information
  at: https://github.com/davidcsterratt/retistruct/issues/13
