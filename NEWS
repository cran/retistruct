CHANGES IN VERSION 0.6.1 - Released 2019/12/08

NEW FEATURES

* Allow resizing of windows
  (https://github.com/davidcsterratt/retistruct/issues/34)

* Allow data counts to be read in using ijroi and csv formats
  (https://github.com/davidcsterratt/retistruct/issues/37)

* Expose the mapping from flat coordinates to spherical coordinates in
  reconstruected retina
  (https://github.com/davidcsterratt/retistruct/issues/20)
  This is achieved by the new member function mapFlatToSpherical() of
  a ReconstructedOutline object

BUG FIXES

* Reinstated saving reconstructed data
  (https://github.com/davidcsterratt/retistruct/issues/27)

* Reinstated sphericalplot
  (https://github.com/davidcsterratt/retistruct/issues/28)

* retistruct.batch.summary() fails on retinae without CountSets
  (https://github.com/davidcsterratt/retistruct/issues/30)

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.6.0 - Released 2019/07/10

BUG FIXES

* Error unclear with infinite determinant in retistruct.reconstruct
  (https://github.com/davidcsterratt/retistruct/issues/21)
  Thanks to Brian Cohn for reporting this, and to Inmaculada Soldado
  and Klaudia Szatko for reporting the same problem and contributing
  an example that gave the same error.

CODE IMPROVEMENTS

* Major refactor of code to use R6 classes
  (https://github.com/davidcsterratt/retistruct/issues/25)

* Stitching algorithm changed so it only creates new points when they
  lie outwith tolerance a of an existing one. This prevents very short
  lengths in triangulated outlines.
  (https://github.com/davidcsterratt/retistruct/issues/21) This work
  arose from the bug with the indefinite determinant (see above).

NEW FEATURES

* It is now possible to have completely silent operation
  (https://github.com/davidcsterratt/retistruct/issues/22)
  Thanks to Brian Cohn for the suggestion

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.5.12 - Released 2017/08/08

NEW FEATURES

* AnnotatedOutline() and Outline() are exported to allow use with
  external packages
  (https://github.com/davidcsterratt/retistruct/issues/17)
  Thanks to Brian Cohn for the report and the patch.

BUG FIXES

* Documentation has been spell checked using devtools::spell_check()
  (https://github.com/davidcsterratt/retistruct/issues/19)

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.5.11 - Released 2017/07/15

RELEASE NOTES

* R 3.4.0 is required to run the graphical user interface (GUI),
  because there is no version of the RGtk2 package that works with
  earlier versions of R available on CRAN.

* There is a bug in version 1.0.5 of gWidgets2RGtk that prevents the GUI
  working. If you encounter this problem, work around it by typing

    install.packages("gWidgets2RGtk2")

  in the R console and then running retistruct() again. (You may need
  to quit R befor being able to run this command.) More information
  at: https://github.com/davidcsterratt/retistruct/issues/13

NEW FEATURES

* The CSV input format can now take a file of counts (or "grouped") data
  (https://github.com/davidcsterratt/retistruct/issues/7)
  Thanks to Nicolas Nagoo for the report.

BUG FIXES

* 3D (RGL) plot now appears after reconstruction
  (https://github.com/davidcsterratt/retistruct/issues/5)
  Thanks to Nicolas Nagoo for the report.

* gWidgets2RGtk not found and package.dependencies() is deprecated
  (https://github.com/davidcsterratt/retistruct/issues/12)

* gWidgets2::gdroplist is deprecated
  (https://github.com/davidcsterratt/retistruct/issues/10)

* Test failed buiding on Windows i386
  (https://github.com/davidcsterratt/retistruct/issues/14)

* Issue with adding tears in retistruct
  (https://github.com/davidcsterratt/retistruct/issues/11)
  Thanks to https://github.com/sagewiltse for the report.

CODE IMPROVEMENTS

* gWidgets2 is now used instead of gWidgets. Thanks to John Verzani
  for fixing bugs in gWidgets2.

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.5.10 - Released 2015/02/16

CODE IMPROVEMENTS

* retistruct:::bary.to.sphere.cart() and
  retistruct:::sphere.cart.to.sphere.spherical() are exported.
  (https://github.com/davidcsterratt/retistruct/issues/2) 
  Thanks to Brian Cohn for the request.

BUG FIXES

* The message produced by delaunayn() in geometry package 0.3-5 has
  been suppressed.
  (https://github.com/davidcsterratt/retistruct/issues/3)
  Thanks to Brian Cohn for the report.
